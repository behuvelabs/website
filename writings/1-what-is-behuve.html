        <h1 id="article-title">What is Behuve?</h1>
        <p><em>Noah Wong · January 21, 2026</em></p>

        <h2>The short answer</h2>
        <p>
            Behuve Labs is a platform that hosts technical blog posts and software tools. 
        </p>
        <h2>The long(er) answer</h2>
        <p>
            The name “behuve” comes from “behoof,” an archaic term meaning “benefit or advantage.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, our goal is to benefit readers, companies, and developers by sharing our thoughts, findings, and software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to help make topics like security, AI, and software seem digestible, and to promote thoughtful discourse about technology. 
        </p
        ><p>
            We’re looking for people who care about how technology is built and used: people who would like to use technology to “behuve.”
